The **Dynamic Client Registration Conformance Tool** is an Open Source test tool provided by [Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/).

The [Dynamic Client Registration](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1078034771/Dynamic+Client+Registration+-+v3.2) APIs allow TPPs to register one or more clients with a
ASPSPs in a manner that offers very low friction and removes hurdles and barriers to entry. The goal of the DCR Conformance Tool is to allow implementers of DCR to test a interface against the DCR standard.

The supporting documentation assumes technical understanding of the Open Banking ecosystem and DCR. An introduction to the concepts is available via the [Open Banking Website](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/).
